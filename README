About the source code:
1. This is a modified version of the feature sign algorithm, for solving a 2-step least square minimization with l1 regularization.

About the copy right:
All of the included files except the following ones
1. l1ls_featuresign2.m
2. sparse_learning.m
3. tsavefigures.m
4. log2file.m
5. sparse_test.m
6. compute_err.m(*), this function is a part from ksvdbox/ksvd.m, source code of ksvd can be found at http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~elad/software/

are a copy from 'Honglak Lee <hllee@cs.stanford.edu>', the detail of the original feature sign algorithm is described in the following paper

Another archive of the original feature sign algorithm source code can be found at: http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/softwares/nips06-sparsecoding.htm

About the usage:
1. 2006.csv is the probe trace file for testing sparse representation on trace data
2. use sparse_test.m to excute the sparse feature sign for probe trace data
3. user the demo_fast_sc.m to show the original algorithm (more input data needed and can be download from http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/softwares/nips06-sparsecoding.htm)
